## üî• Pro Tips

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Domain not working after 2 hours"

**Check DNS propagation:**
- Go to: https://www.whatsmydns.net/

**If not propagating:**

### "CORS error" in browser console

**Fix:**
- Update backend CORS origins (see Step 3)
- Must include BOTH `https://texasenergyanalyzer.com` and `https://www.texasenergyanalyzer.com`
- Redeploy backend after changing

### "SSL certificate error"

**Vercel:**
- Usually auto-fixes within 24 hours
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Click "Refresh Certificate"

**Railway:**
- Check domain is correctly pointed
- May need to remove and re-add custom domain

### "www not working" or "non-www not working"

**Fix:**
- Make sure you have BOTH @ and www DNS records
- Vercel/Railway should handle redirects automatically
- If not, add redirect rule in Vercel/Railway settings
