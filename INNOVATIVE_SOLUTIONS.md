# üöÄ Innovative Solutions for Real-Time Texas Energy Pricing

## The Problem
Current scraper pulls from static blog posts with outdated pricing. We need LIVE data from actual providers.

## üí° Creative Solutions (Ranked by Feasibility)

### 1. **Browser Automation with Playwright/Selenium** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why it works:** PowerToChoose.org loads data dynamically via JavaScript. Traditional HTTP requests don't execute JS.

**Implementation:**
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def scrape_powertochoose_live(zip_code="75001"):
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = browser.new_page()

        # Go to PowerToChoose
        page.goto("https://www.powertochoose.org")

        # Enter zip code and search
        page.fill('input[name="zip_code"]', zip_code)
        page.click('button[type="submit"]')

        # Wait for results to load
        page.wait_for_selector('.plan-result')

        # Extract plan data from rendered page
        plans = page.query_selector_all('.plan-result')
        data = []
        for plan in plans:
            data.append({
                'provider': plan.query_selector('.provider-name').inner_text(),
                'plan_name': plan.query_selector('.plan-name').inner_text(),
                'rate': plan.query_selector('.rate').inner_text(),
                'term': plan.query_selector('.term').inner_text()
            })

        browser.close()
        return data
```

**Pros:**
- Gets REAL, current data from the official PUCT site
- Bypasses JavaScript rendering issues
- Can handle CAPTCHAs with human-in-loop
- Works with any dynamic website

**Cons:**
- Slower than API calls (5-10 seconds per scrape)
- More resource intensive
- Requires browser binaries

### 2. **Reverse Engineer PowerToChoose API** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why it works:** Their frontend MUST call some API to get data. We can intercept it.

**How to find it:**
1. Open PowerToChoose.org in Chrome
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Search for a zip code
4. Look for XHR/Fetch requests with JSON responses
5. Copy the request as cURL
6. Replicate in Python

**Expected endpoint (based on typical .NET apps):**
```
POST https://www.powertochoose.org/api/Plans/Search
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "zip": "75001",
  "language": "en",
  "sort_by": "rate_1000",
  "page": 1
}
```

**Pros:**
- Fast (milliseconds)
- Lightweight
- Can be automated easily
- Gets fresh data every time

**Cons:**
- API might change without notice
- May have rate limiting
- Could violate ToS (check first)

---

### 3. **GridStatus Python SDK** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why it works:** Professional-grade aggregator with real APIs

**Implementation:**
```python
from gridstatus import Ercot

ercot = Ercot()

# Get real-time wholesale prices
lmp = ercot.get_lmp_by_bus(latest=True)

# Get load forecast
load = ercot.get_load_forecast("today")

# Get fuel mix (solar/wind/gas)
fuel_mix = ercot.get_fuel_mix("latest")
```

**What you get:**
- Real-time ERCOT wholesale prices
- Load forecasts
- Generation mix
- Renewable penetration

**What you DON'T get:**
- Retail provider pricing (that's proprietary)

**Pros:**
- Official ERCOT data
- Well-maintained SDK
- Free tier available
- Real-time updates

**Cons:**
- Only wholesale, not retail
- Doesn't tell you what TXU/Gexa charge

---

### 4. **RSS/Email Alert Scraping** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why it works:** Many providers send price alerts via email

**Implementation:**
```python
import imaplib
import email

# Connect to email
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')
mail.login('your_email@gmail.com', 'password')
mail.select('inbox')

# Search for provider emails
_, data = mail.search(None, 'FROM', 'txu@txu.com')

# Parse rate changes from emails
for num in data[0].split():
    _, msg_data = mail.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')
    email_body = email.message_from_bytes(msg_data[0][1])
    # Extract rates using regex
```

**Pros:**
- Providers send you updates
- Can catch promotional rates
- No scraping required

**Cons:**
- Requires email signup for each provider
- Not all providers send regular updates
- Delayed (not real-time)

---

### 5. **Web Archive API for Historical Trends** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why it works:** Wayback Machine has historical snapshots

**Implementation:**
```python
import requests

def get_historical_rates(url, date):
    wayback_url = f"https://archive.org/wayback/available?url={url}&timestamp={date}"
    response = requests.get(wayback_url)
    snapshot = response.json()

    if snapshot['archived_snapshots']:
        archived_url = snapshot['archived_snapshots']['closest']['url']
        # Scrape from archived version
        return scrape_from_url(archived_url)
```

**Use case:**
- Build historical pricing database
- Identify seasonal trends
- Predict future rates

---

### 6. **Crowdsourced Data Collection** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why it works:** Turn users into data collectors

**Implementation:**
- Create browser extension
- Users install it
- Extension captures pricing from PowerToChoose when they visit
- Uploads to your central database
- Everyone benefits from aggregated real-time data

**Pros:**
- Distributed data collection
- Real user data
- Scales automatically
- No single point of failure

**Cons:**
- Requires users to install extension
- Privacy concerns
- Legal gray area

---

### 7. **LLM-Powered Adaptive Scraping** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **MOST INNOVATIVE**
**Why it works:** Website layouts change, but LLMs can adapt

**Implementation:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI

def adaptive_scrape(html_content):
    client = OpenAI()

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{
            "role": "system",
            "content": "Extract electricity plan data from HTML. Return JSON with provider, plan_name, rate_cents, and contract_months."
        }, {
            "role": "user",
            "content": html_content
        }],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    )

    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Why it's revolutionary:**
- Works even when websites redesign
- Can parse unstructured text
- Handles multiple formats automatically
- Self-healing scraper

**Example:**
```python
# This works on ANY energy website
html = requests.get("https://www.reliant.com/en/residential/shop-electricity-rates-and-plans.jsp").text
plans = adaptive_scrape(html)
# Returns structured data even if site layout changed
```

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Multi-Source Hybrid**

Combine multiple sources for maximum coverage:

```python
class InnovativeEnergyDataCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.playwright_scraper = PlaywrightScraper()  # PowerToChoose
        self.llm_scraper = LLMScraper()                # Provider sites
        self.gridstatus = GridStatus()                 # ERCOT wholesale
        self.cache = RedisCache()                      # 1-hour cache

    async def get_live_pricing(self, zip_code):
        # Try cache first
        if cached := self.cache.get(zip_code):
            return cached

        # Parallel execution
        results = await asyncio.gather(
            self.playwright_scraper.scrape_powertochoose(zip_code),
            self.llm_scraper.scrape_provider_sites(),
            self.gridstatus.get_wholesale_prices()
        )

        # Merge and validate
        merged = self.merge_sources(results)
        self.cache.set(zip_code, merged, ttl=3600)

        return merged
```
