# ðŸš€ Deploy Frontend - 3-Minute Guide

**Your backend is already live:** https://web-production-665ac.up.railway.app/

**Now let's deploy the frontend so you can access it from your work laptop!**

---

## âš¡ FASTEST METHOD - Railway Dashboard (3 clicks!)

### Step 1: Open Railway Dashboard
Click this link: **https://railway.app/new**

Or go to: https://railway.app/dashboard â†’ Click your existing project

### Step 2: Add New Service
1. Click **"+ New Service"**
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose: **texas-energy-analyzer**
4. Railway detects it's a monorepo
5. Select **ROOT DIRECTORY: `frontend`**

### Step 3: Configure (Railway auto-detects most settings!)
Railway will automatically use the `railway.json` file I created.

Just add this ONE environment variable:
- Go to **Settings â†’ Variables**
- Click **"+ New Variable"**
- Name: `VITE_API_URL`
- Value: `https://web-production-665ac.up.railway.app`
- Click **"Add"**

### Step 4: Deploy!
Railway will:
- âœ… Install dependencies (npm install)
- âœ… Build your app (npm run build)
- âœ… Start serving it
- âœ… Give you a URL!

**Deployment takes 2-3 minutes.**

### Step 5: Get Your URL
Once deployed, Railway gives you a URL like:
```
https://texas-energy-frontend-production-xyz.up.railway.app
```

**THAT'S IT! Open that URL from any device including your work laptop!**

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to API"

**Fix:** Check CORS in backend

Your backend at `https://web-production-665ac.up.railway.app/` needs to allow your frontend URL.

**Quick Fix:**
1. Go to your backend service in Railway
2. Add environment variable:
   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-url.up.railway.app
   ```
3. Or update `backend/app/main.py` CORS settings and redeploy

### "Build failed"

**Most common issue:** Missing dependencies

**Fix:**
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Look for error messages
3. Usually fixed by redeploying (click "Redeploy")

### "Page is blank"

**Fix:** Check browser console (F12)
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Usually means environment variable `VITE_API_URL` is missing
- Add it in Railway Settings â†’ Variables
