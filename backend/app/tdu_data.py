# TDU information summary
TDU_SUMMARY = """
## What are TDUs?

Transmission and Distribution Utilities (TDUs), also called TDSPs (Transmission and
Distribution Service Providers), are regulated utilities that own and maintain the
physical infrastructure that delivers electricity to your home or business.

## Key Facts:

- **You don't choose your TDU** - It's determined by your location
- **TDU charges are the same regardless of which retail provider you choose**
- **TDU fees now account for about 40% of your total electricity bill**
- **Rates change twice per year**: March 1 and September 1
- **All rates are regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT)**

## What TDUs Do:

- Maintain power lines, poles, and transformers
- Restore power during outages
- Read meters and manage connections
- Deliver electricity from power plants to your location

## What TDUs Don't Do:

- Sell electricity (that's your retail electric provider's job)
- Set energy rates (only delivery rates)
- Handle billing for energy charges

When comparing electricity plans, remember to account for TDU delivery charges,
which are added to your retail provider's energy charges.
